Who searches for things one at a time? Everyone, online. Rarely, in real life. Don't you want to go to a restaurant and pick up sunscreen
if you're close to a Target? Or are you like me, and stuck finding Raising Cane's for your oldest (his favorite), while the youngest won't 
eat anything that ever squawked? 

So a new app is coming out to address that issue.... tell it where you're starting from, and what you want to find, and it will show you 
where those things are, nicely color coded. So all the Cane's will be red, and the vegan places will be blue... ta da! You can easily
scan to see where those things are close to each other, avoiding that infinite do loop of "search, try to remember, search again" that 
we've all experienced. 

So, enjoy! May you use it in slight less harried good health.
