Introduction/Business Problem:
Users often want to find disparate things in a common area: run to the post office and pick up food at the same time, 
get several different types of food in a single trip, etc. This is a personal pain point for me: I want to find what 
burger places are around a Raising Cane’s, and with the changing zooms and recentering, trying to remember where one 
is while running the other search is frustrating. Users need a way to find “clusters” of target options with 
their particular targets. 

Data: 
I will use inputs from a user (mock, since I have no idea how to allow inputs in a Jupyter notebook) of start 
point (zip or address). I will get data from Four square regarding venues in the target category, then show the clusters on a map.
